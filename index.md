# Rona Darabi's CSE 110 Page 

## About 
Hi! My name is Rona and I am a third-year studying mathematics-computer science at *University of California, San Diego*. Coding interests me because it is applicable to almost anything and serves as a creative outlet.
This Ada Lovelace quote 
>The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be

has always inspired me, and I can even remember my first ```print('Hello world!')```. 

## Other interests 
Outside of school, I am a member of the [KSDT Radio Station](https://ksdt.ucsd.edu/). I am a part of the following groups there: 
- DJ
- Audio Engineering
- Events

Being surrounded by music all the time has encouraged me to learn
- [ ] Guitar
- [ ] Piano

both of which are clearly in progress...

I also love to watch movies. These are my top 5 favorite currently.
1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
2. Before Sunset
3. City of God
4. La Haine
5. Good Will Hunting

I can't forget to mention that I have a cat! Her name is [Zuri](cse110/zuri.md) and she is 6 years old.
